# Lead_Scoring_Assignment
Objective is to build a model such that score for each leads is generated based on the model. This is important for the company to identify hot leads and cold leads.

An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. On any given day, many professionals who are interested in the courses land on their website and browse for courses.

X Education gets a lot of leads, its lead conversion rate is very poor. To make this process more efficient, the company wishes to identify the most potential leads, also known as ‘Hot Leads’. If they successfully identify this set of leads, the lead conversion rate should go up as the sales team will now be focusing more on communicating with the potential leads rather than making calls to everyone.

The company requires to build a model wherein there is a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance.

**Goals of the Case Study**

1) Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads.

2) There are some more problems presented by the company which the model should be able to adjust to if the company's requirement changes in the future. These problems are provided in a separate doc file.
